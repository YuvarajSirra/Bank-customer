#Bank customers chrun
Customer churn in banks refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using the bank's services, often by closing their accounts or switching to a competitor. It is an important metric for banks to monitor, as high levels of churn can indicate dissatisfaction, a decline in customer loyalty, or increased competition. 

Churn is typically measured by the **churn rate**, which is the percentage of customers who leave the bank over a specific period. Understanding and predicting customer churn helps banks identify customers at risk of leaving, allowing them to take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering better services, incentives, or addressing complaints. 

In banking, customer churn can be influenced by factors such as:

- **Poor customer service**
- **High fees**
- **Better offers from competitors**
- **Changes in customer needs or financial circumstances**
- **Negative experiences with the bank**

This dataset contains information about bank customers and their churn status, which indicates whether they have exited the bank or not. It is suitable for exploring and analyzing factors influencing customer churn in banking institutions and for building predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning.
