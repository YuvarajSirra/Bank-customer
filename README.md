#Bank customers chrun
Customer churn in banks refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using the bank's services, often by closing their accounts or switching to a competitor. It is an important metric for banks to monitor, as high levels of churn can indicate dissatisfaction, a decline in customer loyalty, or increased competition. 

Churn is typically measured by the **churn rate**, which is the percentage of customers who leave the bank over a specific period. Understanding and predicting customer churn helps banks identify customers at risk of leaving, allowing them to take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering better services, incentives, or addressing complaints. 

In banking, customer churn can be influenced by factors such as:

- **Poor customer service**
- **High fees**
- **Better offers from competitors**
- **Changes in customer needs or financial circumstances**
- **Negative experiences with the bank**
  
The "Bank-customer" dataset provides information about bank customers and their churn status, which indicates whether or not they have left the bank. This dataset is useful for analyzing the factors influencing customer churn in banking institutions and for developing predictive models to identify customers at risk of leaving.
